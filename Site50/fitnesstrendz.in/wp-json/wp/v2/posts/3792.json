One thing you should know about pre workout, it is not your whey protein or BCAA which you can take throughout your life. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should use pre workout only when you feel tired or exhausted. Never make a habit of taking pre workout on a daily basis. If you are using 30 serving pack so use it wisely when you feel you need it, and extend it for at least 2 months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This supplement is only for those who have the age of 18 and above. If you have a blood pressure problem so don&#8217;t use any pre-workout supplement. Every pre workout contains caffeine which is not ideal for BP patients. Also, never take pre-workout before sleep. There should be at least a 5-6 hour gap between your pre workout intake and your sleep. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-accent-color has-text-color\"><strong>Benefits of pre workout<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Boost Power<\/strong><\/strong>:  Pre-workout contains caffeine which drastically boosts your power which helps you in a sudden burst of activity such as sprint or high-intensity interval training (HIIT). It will also prevent muscular fatigue that allows you to perform more reps before your muscles give out. It will Improve body composition that leads to greater increases in lean muscle mass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Improve Endurance<\/strong>:  It has citrulline which improves your endurance performance. If you have the potential of an intense workout for 1 hour so you can easily increase it further using the pre-workout supplement. in one study, participants who consumed pre-workout before a treadmill exercise trial were able to run for 12.5% longer than those who didn\u2019t take the pre-workout.&nbsp;So, it would seem pre-workout could be beneficial for those who are in it for the long run too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Increase mental focus:<\/strong> As well as physical effects, pre-workout enhances mental focus alertness, reaction time, perception of energy, and positive vibes.&nbsp;If you\u2019re a regular exerciser, you\u2019ll know that half of the success comes from mentality \u2014 if your head is in the right place, your body will follow. These are the pre workout supplement benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-accent-color has-text-color\"><strong>Pre workout must have Ingredients<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. BCAA<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>BCAA&#8217;s has 3 amino acids includes, Leucine, Isoleucine and Valine. It will give you instant energy and for blunting fatigue. Unlike most amino acids which have to go the liver, get broken down and then the liver decide what to do with them. BCAA&#8217;s directly go to your muscle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. BETA-ALANINE<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>BETA-ALANINE helps to blunt fatigue. It needs to be build up in the muscle. When you consume this it produces Karnas. Karnas is the real player in BETA-ALANINE and you are just using beta alanine as a source to make this ingredients.  2 gram of BETA-ALANINE is the daily recommendation by the experts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. Creatine HCL<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Creatine hydrochloride will help you to increase your strength over a long period of time and helps you to lift heavy. One of the pre-workout ingredients leucine helps to increase insulin level and insulin opens up the doors in the muscle that allow creatine to get in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>4. Betaine<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Betaine is very important ingredients in pre workout. They provide all source of health benefits including Liver, joint and brain health and also helps in muscle growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>5. Citrulline Malate<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the pre-workout uses Arginine in their supplement because arginine directly converts in nitric acid however there is a problem with arginine it&#8217;s poorly absorbed. That&#8217;s where Citrulline comes into the picture once Citrulline in the bloodstream, it converts into arginine produces nitric acid which gives you a massive pump during the workout session.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-accent-color has-text-color\"><strong>Best pre workout in India 202<\/strong>2<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are India\u2019s best Pre workout brands<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Insane Labz Psychotic Infused Preworkout Powerhouse<\/li><li>Doctor&#8217;s Choice PRE-X5 Ultimate Professional Pre-Workout<\/li><li>Muscle Asylum F9 Extreme Pre-Workout Energy Supplement<\/li><li>WILD BUCK Hyper Charge Pre-X4 Hardcore Pre-Workout&nbsp;<\/li><li>Bigmuscles Nutrition Shredz Pre Preworkout<\/li><li>Cellucor C4 Pre-Workout Explosive Energy<\/li><li>Pro Supps Mr. Hyde Nitrox Intense Energy Pre-Workout<\/li><li>GAT Nitraflex Pre workout Supplement<\/li><li>Muscletech Neurocore Pro Series<\/li><li>Muscleblaze&nbsp;bGREEN Up-Beet Pre-Sports<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-accent-color has-text-color\">Insane Labz Psychotic Infused Preworkout Powerhouse<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/30HnDU1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/fitnesstrendz.inwp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/download-12-min.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3817\" width=\"309\" height=\"336\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Insane Labz Psychotic Infused Preworkout is one of the most popular pre-workout available in the market.

I am personally using these pre workout supplements and the results are phenomenal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I am again stating that no supplement will work on your body if your diet, workout and rest are not in a place so keeps in mind that your nutrition has to be top-notch and your sleep time would be at least 6-8 hours per day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for Best whey protein supplement along with the pre workout so you can checkout my article, <a href=\"https:\/\/fitnesstrendz.inbest-whey-protein-powders-in-india\/\">10 Best Whey Protein in India 2022. <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-accent-color has-text-color\">Pre-workout for Men and Women<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The body of men and women has different in terms of physiques, shape, and structure. On the nutrition and nutrient front, women and men need are identical ones. Additionally, for women, the&nbsp;addition of biotin, chromium, and l-carnitine are best in helping maximize their exercising results because the female bodies process dietary supplements in a different way than men.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also require a different level of the vitamin than men\u2019s, while the great pre-exercising dietary supplements for girls are quite exceptional than those which might be marketed closer to men.The reason is simple as girls have far less testosterone than men, it can be much harder for girls to construct muscle than men.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, positive pre-exercising supplements are more helpful for men, and they can come to be too harsh for girls. But women can also take pre-workout to enhance their performance, it may not help to gain muscle but definitely help you to boost your energy and stamina. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-accent-color has-text-color\">FAQs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q1.
