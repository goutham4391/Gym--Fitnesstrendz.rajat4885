It is an essential fatty acid that plays an important role in your body and provides you various health benefits. It is basically found in foods, such as fish and flaxseed. It is also present in dietary supplements such as Fish oil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three main omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). ALA is found mainly in plant oils such as flaxseed,&nbsp;soybean, they all are highly important components of the membranes that surround each cell in your body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many foods available in the market through which you can consume omega-3 naturally. I am mentioning some of them.<br>* Fish and other seafood (especially cold-water fatty fish, such as salmon fish and tuna fish)<br>* Nuts and seeds (such as flaxseed, chia seeds, and walnuts)<br>* Plant oils (such as flaxseed oil, soybean oil, and canola oil)<br>* Fortified foods (such as certain brands of eggs, yogurt, juices, milk, soy beverages)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-accent-color has-text-color\"><strong>Top 12 Health Benefits Omega 3<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">1.

Omega 3 can reduce insulin resistance, fight inflammation and improve several heart disease risk factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">5. Fight Inflammation<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Inflammation is a natural response to infections and damage to your body. sometimes it persists for a long time, even without an infection or injury which is called chronic or long terms inflation which causes heart disease and cancer. Notably, omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the production of molecules and substances linked to inflammation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">6. Improve Mental Disorders<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to high-stress level, people are facing so many mental disorders such as psychiatric&nbsp;disorders, mood swings, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Regular use of omega 3 can reduce the chances of mental disorders and also decrease violent behavior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">7.

Studies have shown that people who consume omega 3s have 55% lower risk of colon cancer. it is also linked to a reduced risk of prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">8. Reduce Asthma in Children<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Asthma is a chronic lung disease with symptoms like coughing, shortness of breath, and wheezing. sometimes, asthma attacks can be very dangerous. unfortunately, asthma rates in India have been rising over the past few decades due to bad air quality. so you can simply reduce the risk by adding omega 3 in your daily routine. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">9.

If you are looking for a veg option so you can go for <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3yl6KO3\">Himalayan Organics Omega 3<\/a>. I am personally using these and the results are phenomenal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with that your diet, workout, and rest need to be in place so keeps in mind that your nutrition has to be top-notch and your sleep time should be at least 6-8 hours per day. Apart from this, as you know that omega 3 is extracted from fish so always consume these capsules with plenty of water to avoid fishy burps. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for the best whey protein supplement along with the omega 3s so you can check out my article,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/fitnesstrendz.inbest-whey-protein-powders-in-india\/\">10 Best Whey Protein in India 2022.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-accent-color has-text-color\"><strong>FAQs<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\"><strong>How do I select a high-quality omega-3 supplement?<\/strong><br>The key to selecting a high-quality omega-3 supplement is to read the label to identify how much EPA and DHA is included in each serving. You don&#8217;t need to worry about this because all the brands which I mentioned above provide you with the required intake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\"><strong>How do omega-3s differ from omega-6s?<\/strong><br>A key difference between these fatty acids is where they are found. Omega-3s come primarily from cold-water fatty fish while omega-6s are found in plant oils, including corn, soybean, and sunflower oils.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\"><strong>How sustainable are omega-3 supplements?<\/strong><br>Many of the fisheries from which marine oils are sourced have either been certified\u2014or are currently pursuing certification\u2014by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). So you can consider them sustainable. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\"><strong>Can we get enough omega 3s from the food we eat?<\/strong><br>Fish is the primary food source of the omega-3s EPA and DHA, but Indians simply don\u2019t eat enough fish on a regular basis. Even those who eat fish several times a week aren\u2019t getting enough EPA and DHA because much of the fish consumed today is farm-raised and lacks significant amounts of EPA and DHA. So in order to get enough omega 3s, you need to look after other external sources. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\"><strong>Do pregnent women need omega 3s?<\/strong><br>It is especially important for pregnant and breastfeeding women to consume DHA (one of the omega-3s in fish oil) because the developing baby is dependent on the mother. It is also beneficial for the brain health of a baby.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Omega 3 is very beneficial for various health purposes.
