Green tea is originated from the plant named <strong>Camellia Sinensis.<\/strong> It is made by lightly steaming leaves from the Camellia Sinensis plant, which is the same plant used to make black and oolong teas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green tea is primarily water-based and the best part about green tea is that It doesn\u2019t contain any fat, carbohydrates, or protein, and there aren\u2019t any calories in unsweetened tea. It means it\u2019s free of the usual macronutrients found in other foods and drinks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green tea is one of the least oxidized tea types. It is made from young tea leaves plucked towards the close of the flush or harvest season after the production of white, oolong, and black teas.
