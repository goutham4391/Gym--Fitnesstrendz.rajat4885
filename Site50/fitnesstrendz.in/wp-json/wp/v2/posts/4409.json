The treadmill can make you happy and healthy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Runs and aerobic exercises like cycling cause the release of more endorphins in the brain. Endorphins are a chemical compound found in your brain that makes you feel happy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of a treadmill at home can consequently help relieve depression and anxiety.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">2.  <strong>Heart Health<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Running regularly may be one of the best things you can do for your cardiovascular health, or your heart health, in other words. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one, regular aerobic exercise helps increase the strength of your heart and the circulation of blood in your body. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More circulation means that your muscles get more oxygen, thus working harder for longer and getting more results from every run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">3. <strong>Muscle Building <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There is much more to running than cardio and stamina, even though you might think it is only suitable for those things. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running, of course, engages your muscles, which means your muscles are also being built. Running will increase the muscle mass in your legs and strengthens your leg muscles. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to increasing the strength of your core, you can enhance it by running with your abdominal muscles flexed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">4.<strong> Reduce Joint impact<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A treadmill reduces impact better than the street or other outdoor surfaces when it comes to running. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every time you take a step while running on the pavement, dirt, or even hard surfaces, your legs take a lot of impact, especially when you go fast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, these can cause severe health problems in our old age, as well as painful bone fractures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">5. <strong>You are in control<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Running on a treadmill will also benefit you in the fact that you have complete control over it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your fitness level, you may want to have a light workout, or you might be an experienced runner wanting an intense workout. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point is that on a treadmill, you can control all of the aspects to suit your fitness level to a tee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-accent-color has-text-color\"><strong><strong>Things you need to keep in mind while purchasing treadmill<\/strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Treadmills are operated by a <strong>motor <\/strong>that turns the belt. The motor is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;heart&#8221; of the treadmill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This motor is typically between a 1.5 to 3 horsepower motor that allows for the belt to rotate as you walk, jog or run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>deck <\/strong>is an important component in not only the design of the treadmill but also its performance. The first thing that you have to look at is the frame.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to make sure that it is solid. Steel is the best option for the frames.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>rollers <\/strong>are what support the belt that in turn allows for you to walk, jog or run. The bigger and heavier they are, the better they are.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their job is to reduce the stress of the belt and motor. This will in turn make the treadmill last long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most treadmills have 2 ply <strong>belts <\/strong>that are of the same thickness. Anything less would not be recommended. The <strong>stronger <\/strong>the belt, the better it will perform and last.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The size of the belts ranges from 14 to 24 inches wide.&nbsp;It is recommended that the bigger you are, the bigger your treadmill should be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <strong>user console<\/strong>, There is usually a heart\/pulse monitor as well. You should have speed and incline controls that will allow adjusting for pace and difficulty levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-accent-color has-text-color\"><strong>Home Treadmill Lis<\/strong>t<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the top 10 Best treadmill for home<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>PowerMax Fitness TDM-9x Series &#8211; Light, Foldable, Electric Treadmill<\/li><li>Durafit Spark 1.25 HP (Peak 2.5 HP) DC Motorized Treadmill<\/li><li>Cockatoo CTM-05 1.5 HP &#8211; 2HP Peak DC Motorized Treadmill for Home,<\/li><li>Sparnod Fitness STH-1200 (3 HP Peak) Automatic Treadmill<\/li><li>Fitkit FT98 carbon (2HP Peak) DC-Motorised Treadmill<\/li><li>Lifelong Fit Pro 2 HP Peak Motorized Treadmill for Home&nbsp;<\/li><li>Reach T-301-4 HP Peak DC Motor Indoor Motorized Smart Hydraulic Folding Treadmill<\/li><li>Kobo Home Series 1 HP &#8211; 2 HP Peak Motorised Multi-Function Treadmill<\/li><li>ENDLESS SENFIT000BLGR-Casa Casa Easy to Use Treadmill<\/li><li>AGARO Spark Motorized Treadmill 1.5 HP (Peak 3.0 HP) Folding Treadmill<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.

Adjust both speeds and incline during your workout, and you can better simulate the changing terrain of a road run.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Is it OK to walk on the treadmill every day?<\/strong><br>Once you are used to treadmill walking, you can&nbsp;<strong>do it every day of the week<\/strong>. Walking at a brisk pace for 30 to 60 minutes most days of the week is recommended to reduce health risks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Does the treadmill burn belly fat?<\/strong><br>There is no exercise that burns your spot fat but yes if you keep your diet in a caloric deficit and do a regular treadmill then it definitely helps you lose overall body fat along with belly area.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We all have a very busy lifestyle and it is hard to take some time to the gym.
